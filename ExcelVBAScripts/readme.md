This folder contains all VBA scripts I wrote for my master thesis. The databases were all provided as Excel files and data processing was done through a slow and constantly crashing program. Due to the short timeline of the data collection and the large amount of data I had to process I decided to delve into VBA and write scripts to process all data (instead of spending all my time on manually searching and manipulating the data).

The Auto Process SDC Data script has been created to replace a native desktop application that was reading from the SDC excel files. I found that the native application was to slow and using a VBA script directly in Excel sped up the process drastically. However, it has been tailored mainly to suit my data. Especially the data parsing is only applied to the data columns I needed. Please contact me if you have any questions about this script. If I notice there is more interest in this application I may write a full size C# application to process the SDC data, let me know!
